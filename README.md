# 🎵🎧 Tracktion 🎧🎵
Tracktion is a service that will use the BandCamp API to monitor artist and song analytics using a cloud-based data pipeline and dashboard to monitor this information, send reports and alerts to musicians and labels, and enable data-driven decisions via interactive visualisations.

## 🚰 ETL Pipeline
The ETL pipeline will ingest BandCamp sales data, transform it into structured data, and load it into a cloud-hosted RDS database for storage and analysis. The pipeline will run on a containerised infrastructure using Docker and Terraform.

## 📈 Visualisation
The data is visualised using Streamlit, a lightweight web app framework chosen for its cost effectiveness and customisation capabilities. Developers can adapt the dashboards to their own needs, offering flexibility in how insights are displayed.
